# Overview

LienStream is a medical lien automation platform that scrapes, processes, and manages liens from county recorder websites (specifically Maricopa County). The system automatically discovers liens over $20,000, enriches debtor information, syncs data to Airtable for CRM management, and triggers direct mail marketing campaigns. Built as a full-stack web application with automated scheduling and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## UI/UX Preferences
- Collapsible sidebar with subtle circular toggle button and arrow icon
- Dashboard organization: Status Cards → Automation Controls → Recent Activity → Configuration & Monitoring
- 12-hour time format with AM/PM selection
- Timezone restrictions to PT, CT, and ET only
- Visual section headers with color-coded indicators for better hierarchy
- Export Data function integrated within Recent Activity section (all data or date range export)
- View Logs function integrated within System Activity section (all logs or date-specific filtering)
- Removed standalone Quick Actions section for cleaner interface

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client uses React with TypeScript in a single-page application (SPA) architecture. The UI is built with shadcn/ui components providing a consistent design system, styled with Tailwind CSS using CSS variables for theming. React Router (wouter) handles navigation, while TanStack Query manages server state and API communication. The application features a sidebar navigation layout with real-time dashboard monitoring.

## Backend Architecture
The server follows a REST API pattern using Express.js with TypeScript. The application uses a modular service architecture with separate services for web scraping (ScraperService), external integrations (AirtableService), task scheduling (SchedulerService), and centralized logging (Logger). All services are orchestrated through a unified storage abstraction layer that currently uses in-memory storage but can be easily swapped for database implementations.

## Data Storage Solutions
The system uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL as the primary database. The schema defines four main entities: users (authentication), liens (core data), automationRuns (execution tracking), and systemLogs (audit trail). The current implementation includes an in-memory storage adapter for development, with the database configuration ready for production deployment via Neon Database.

## Automation & Scheduling
A cron-based scheduler runs daily automation workflows at 6:00 AM, with support for manual triggers via the web interface. The automation pipeline includes: web scraping with Puppeteer, data validation and filtering, Airtable synchronization, and comprehensive logging of each step's success/failure status.

## Authentication & Authorization
Basic user management is implemented through the users table, though the current system appears to operate without active authentication middleware. The schema supports username/password authentication that can be extended with session management or JWT tokens.
